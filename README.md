# Flappy_Bird
Welcome to the Flappy Bird project! This project is a web-based version of the classic Flappy Bird game, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you control a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes without hitting them. The objective is to achieve the highest score by crossing as many hurdles as possible.
